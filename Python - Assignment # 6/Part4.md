    "Class:\n",
    "    A class is a code template for creating objects. Objects have member variables and have behavior associated with them. In python a class is created by the keyword class.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Object:\n",
    "    In computer science, an object can be a variable, a data structure, a function, or a method, and as such, is a value in memory referenced by an identifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the class-based object-oriented programming paradigm, object refers to a particular instance of a class, where the object can be a combination of variables, functions, and data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Attribute:\n",
    "     An attribute is a specification that defines a property of an object, element, or file. It may also refer to or set the specific value for a given instance of such. For clarity, attributes should more correctly be considered metadata. An attribute is frequently and generally a property of a property.\n",
    "        \n",
    "Behavior:\n",
    "    A class's behavior determines how an instance of that class operates; for example, how it will \"react\" if asked to do something by another class or object or if its internal state changes. Behavior is the only way objects can do anything to themselves or have anything done to them.\n",
